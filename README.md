## Deepfake Detection with MesoNet


Today’s technology can be a bit scary. "Deepfakes" are fake images and videos made using deep learning. Unlike photos edited with Photoshop, these fakes look very real. <br>

In this project, I look into Deepfakes using a pre-trained model called MesoNet, which is built to find them. <br>

The research on MesoNet was done by Darius Afchar, Vincent Nozick, Junichi Yamagishi, and Isao Echizen. Their paper was published in September 2018. They made two models trained on different sets of data. I focus on the Meso4 model, which was trained on a dataset created by the MesoNet team. I used their ideas to learn more about how to detect deepfakes and about machine learning. <br>

This project made me curious about deepfakes and why they matter. It’s important for today’s generation to understand them, as knowing how they work can help us spot fake information and protect ourselves from it.
